This project demonstrates how to develop a chess game application using link:https://www.eclipse.org/n4js/[N4JS] and link:https://reactjs.org/[React].
The link:../chess-documentation/README.adoc[Documentation] provides an in-depth tutorial.


== Run the application

In the root folder of the project `n4js-tutorial-chess`, execute the following command to install all dependencies.

[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

In `package.json`, a `start` script for starting the Webpack Dev Server serving the application is defined. To start the application, run

[source,bash]
----
npm start
----

The chess web app is served at port 8080.

The final game will look approximately like this.

== Developer Setup

Follow the following steps to import the app into N4JS IDE.

Step 1: Download the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.n4js/downloads[latest N4JS IDE] for your operating system.

Step 2: The project is already an Eclipse project with the `.project` file in the root `n4js-tutorial-chess` folder. Hence, you can simply import it into the N4JS IDE workspace via `File => Import => Existing Projects into Workspace`.

The IDE may complain that npm dependencies declared in `package.json` are missing. Use the quickfix `run npm/yarn in this project` to fix this issue.

Step 3: Open the library manager dialog and choose `Re-Build node_modules`.

Step 4: Clean & Build the project. After this step, the project has no compilation errors anymore.

== Build the Chess tutorial page

We generate a tutorial page from `n4js-tutorial-chess.adoc` located in the `doc` folder. There is an NPM script called `build-tutorial` that can be used to build the tutorial page. In the root folder `n4js-tutorial-chess` , you can execute this script via

[source,bash]
----
npm run build-tutorial
----

When executed, the script generates the tutorial page and stores all necessary `html`, `js` and image files in the  folder `doc/n4js-tutorial-chess`. You can integrate the chess tutorial into the official N4JS webpage by using this folder.
